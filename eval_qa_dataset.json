  "answer": "The intermittent connection drops when using the 2.5Gbit/s port are likely because the Intel I219-V network card does not support the 2.5 Gbit/s speed. It is designed for 1GbE (1000Base-T) speeds. To utilize the 2.5 Gbit/s port effectively, you would need to install a network card that supports speeds of 10 Gbit/s or more, along with a compatible Ethernet cable (cat 6a or cat 7).",

  "question": "Why do I see unusual connections from my Shelly smart switches on my network, and how can I resolve this issue?",
  "answer": "The unusual connections you're observing from your Shelly smart switches, which appear with names like PC-XXX and MAC addresses starting with 5E:BB:00, are likely not indicative of a security breach but rather a quirk in how these devices interact with your network, particularly when connected through Wlan-Box 2 extenders. You've already tried several troubleshooting steps like adjusting Internet Box settings, using a guest WiFi, and even flashing different firmware versions on both the Internet Box and the Shelly devices without resolving the issue. A temporary workaround was moving the Shellies to a guest WiFi, which eliminated the ghost devices but was impractical for your needs. The issue doesn't seem to occur when the Shellies are connected directly to the Internet Box, suggesting that the Wlan-Box 2 might be handling the connections from the Shellies in a way that generates these unusual entries. Since none of the attempted solutions provided a satisfactory result, and considering that the issue doesn't manifest when using an alternate firmware with native HomeKit support (albeit with limited capabilities), this might suggest a compatibility issue between the Shelly devices' official firmware and your network setup, particularly with the Wlan-Box 2. It may be beneficial to contact Swisscom or Shelly's support for a firmware update or solution that addresses this specific compatibility issue.",
